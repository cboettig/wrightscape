anoles.R  a unit test comparing wrightscape and ouch
auteur_labrids.R  an relatively simple example of auteur run on the labrid dataset
brownie_parrotfish.R an incomplete example of brownie.lite on parrotfish data.  Painting the tree wants simmap formats
labrid_data.R prepare the labrid trait data under transforms and phylogenetic size correction
labrid_mcmc.R example of mcmc on the labrid data, needs refining

labrid_mc.R Preliminary model choice over a suite of traits in the labrid data.  Plot the best-fit parameter values and likelihoods of a variety of model fits without estimating uncertainty (for speed).  

labrid_power.R Phylogenetic monte carlo (bootstrapped likelihood ratio test) pairwise comparisons of several models
labrids.R analysis of the labrid model parameters and likelihoods under bootstrap

mietchen.R analysis of the brain measurements of Prof. Daniel Mietchen on a primate phylogeny from the auteur package
power_plot.R plotting script for the power comparisons between models across traits.  move into *_power.R scripts, and consider adding to package function list. 

primates.R a wrightscape analysis on primate body size data included in auteur package.  (Shows that differences in OU means is best?  Check the notebook..)

sim_mc.R show the basic model choice works clearly on simulated data (essentially a unit-test)
simulation.R bootstrapped comparisons of model choice on simulated data sets
