  abstract	= {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
		  study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
		  methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
		  method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
		  proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
		  both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
		  different from, and more general than, pure drift models
		  based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
		  possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
		  adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
		  one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
		  parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
		  approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
		  adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
		  models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
		  lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
		  details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
		  method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
		  approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
		  allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
		  utilize more of the information content of com- parative
		  data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
		  model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
		  variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
		  alternative evolutionary explanations.},

  abstract	= {The association between diversification and evolutionary
		  innovations has been well documented and tested in studies
		  of taxonomic richness but the impact that such innovations
		  have on the diversity of form and function is less well
		  understood. Using phylogenetically rigorous techniques, we
		  investigated the association between morphological
		  diversity and two design breakthroughs within the jaws of
		  parrotfish. Similar intramandibular joints and other
		  modifications of the pharyngeal jaws have evolved
		  repeatedly in teleost fish and are frequently hypothesized
		  to promote diversity. We quantified morphological diversity
		  within six functionally important oral jaw traits using the
		  Brownian motion rate of evolution to correct for
		  phylogenetic and time-related biases and compared these
		  rates across clades that did and did not possess the
		  intramandibular joint and the parrotfish pharyngeal jaw. No
		  change in morphological diversity was associated with the
		  pharyngeal jaw modification alone but rates of oral jaw
		  diversification were up to 8× faster in parrotfish species
		  that possessed both innovations. Interestingly, this
		  morphological diversity may not have led to differential
		  resource uses as available data suggest that members of
		  this clade show remarkable homogeneity of diet.},
