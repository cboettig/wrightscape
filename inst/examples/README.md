Examples 
========

This is an active research working directory. These examples will continue to evolve.  

* `simulate_release.md` Create a plot visualizing the different models
* `labrid_mc.md` fit each model for the set of interesting traits and return the parameter estimates (no bootstrapping/uncertainty estimation) for the Labrid dataset. 
* `labrid_data.md` Example of pre-processing the labrid data for the phylogenetic analysis. 
* `labrid_power.md` Example of full model-choice between candidate models.
* `labrid_par_bootstrap.md` Runs replicate model fits to get parameter distributions but not replicate model choice. Faster than `labrid_power.md` but slower than `labrid_mc.md`.
